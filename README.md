# Savvy Telemetry API SDK for PHP 

[![Build Status](https://github.com/savvy-telemetry/savvy-php/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/savvy-telemetry/savvy-php)

This library helps with integrating Savvy Telemetry into PHP applications.

## Installation

This library can be installed via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

```bash
composer require savvy-telemetry/savvy-php
```

## Configuration

The only required configuration is the Environment Token. You can get your Environment Token via the [Project settings](https://app.havesavvy.com/admin/projects) in your Savvy Telemetry account.

Configuration values can be set when creating a new API client or via environment variables. The environment variable takes precedence over values provided during the initialization process.

**Configuration via environment variables**

```bash
SAVVY_ENVIRONMENT_TOKEN=tok-sample
```

**Configuration during initialization**

```php
$client = new \Savvy\Client(['environment_token' => 'tok-sample']);
```

## Context

When sending your telemetry data, you may choose to include a context for the data. This context can include info about the user and account for the user. This information will be surfaced in the app for more advanced querying and reporting.

```php
$context = new \Savvy\Entities\Context\Context(
    new \Savvy\Entities\Context\Account('account_id', 'Acme, Inc.',  [
        new \Savvy\Entities\Context\Attribute('key', 'value'),
    ]),
    new \Savvy\Entities\Context\User('user_id', 'John Doe',  [
        new \Savvy\Entities\Context\Attribute('key', 'value'),
    ]),
);

$client = new \Savvy\Client([
    'environment_token' => 'tok-sample-token',
    'context' => $context,
]);
```

## Usage

Before your telemetry data, create a new client. If you configured your environment token key via environment variables there's nothing to add. Otherwise, see the example above.

```php
$client = new \Savvy\Client();
```

### Send telemetry information


```php
$client->telemetry('action-key');
```
